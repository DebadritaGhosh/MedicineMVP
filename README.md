# Medicine Ordering App (MVP)

This is a simple yet fully functional **Medicine Ordering App** built with **React Native**. The app allows users to browse medicines, add them to their cart, checkout, and view their order history. It provides essential features like user authentication, a medicine list with search & filter, a cart system, and order tracking‚Äîall stored locally.

### üìù **Note**:

This **app was created as part of an assignment** to demonstrate my skills in **React Native** development. It's a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and is intended to showcase core functionalities like authentication, cart management, and order history.
